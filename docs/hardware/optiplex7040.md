# Dell OptiPlex 7040

These small servers are perfect for an ITX sized homelab. They provide enough computing power for most tasks
and combined have 16GB of RAM. These servers were the first of my actual hardware I bought.

## Hardware

- 8GB RAM
- 1x with 500GB HDD, 1x with 250GB SSD
- 1x Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6500T CPU @ 2.50GHz

## Services

The services running on the Dell OptiPlexes are listed here. This list is updated frequently.

As my HomeLab has two quite similar Dell OptiPlexes, it can run many services in a hot-hot/hot-cold format.
When listing what services are running, the hostname will be listed beside it.

| Service Name | Hostname       |
