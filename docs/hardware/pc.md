# PC // Poseidon

My personal computer is built in a k39 PC case, and is only 3.9 litres in volume. This was definitely a fun challenge to
build in, but as hardware gets bigger, more power hungy and hotter, this form factor is more than likely dying out.

I have plenty of photos of the computer in various stages of assembly.
