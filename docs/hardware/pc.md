# PC

My personal computer is built in a k39 PC case, and is only 3.9 litres in volume. This was definitely a fun challenge to
build in, but as hardware gets bigger, more power hungy and hotter, this form factor is more than likely dying out.

I have plenty of photos of the computer in various stages of assembly.

## Hardware

- 1x Ryzen 5 3600 CPU @ 3.6GHz, 4.2GHz Boost
- 1x Nvidia GeForce 1660ti ITX
- 2x 16GB 3600MHz RAM
- 1x 512GB M.2 NVME SSD
    - Windows Boot Drive
- 2x 1TB Samsung 970 EVO SSD
    - 1x Windows Game Drive
    - 1x Ubuntu Install
- 1x MSI B450i Motherboard
- 1x 500w Flex ATX PSU

## Peripherals

I have a few peripherals, most revolve around my interest in playing/recording/mixing music, like my interface, some are
just because I spend a lot of time at my desk and therefore comfort is key.

### Sound Based Peripherals

- 1x Presonus AudioBox USB 96
    - This little powerhouse is my audio interface. It is used to drive headphones, speakers, microphones and allow my record
    player to be played through speakers.
- 1x Audio-Technica AT2020 Condenser Microphone
    - This is my main microphone. It hangs on a boom arm over my monitors and uses an XLR cable instead of USB. It sounds
    really clear and was one of the best purchases I made. It was bought in 2018 and is still working well.
- 2x SwisSonic ASM5
    - These studio monitors were another very solid purchase, I have had no issues with them at all. They offer great frequency
    response and are very affordable.
- 1x JAM Vinyl Turntable
    - Finally, my record player is the newest addition to my audiophile setup, playing the records through the second input
    on my interface and either through the speakers or through my headphones. It also has built in bluetooth connectivity!

### Keyboard + Mouse

As these are the most used devices on my desk from day to day, I spent a decent amount of money to ensure I got the best
products for my needs.

- Keychron K6 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard
    - I have never regretted purchasing this 65% keyboard once. It has Cherry MX Brown switches and can be both wired and
    wireless. It is a dream to type on and looks visually striking.
- Logitech G703 Lightspeed
    - The G703 has also been a good choice as far as purchases go. It has a long battery life and is a good shape for my
    hand. It is also wired/wireless and I have had no issues with it.

### Monitors

- 1x ASUS TUFF GAMING 1080p 144Hz 24.5" Monitor
- 1x Dell 1080p 60Hz 23" Monitor

### Extras

There are some other things on my desk that get used frequently

- XBOX One Controller
- Wireless Numpad

All of these add up to produce a set up that looks like this
