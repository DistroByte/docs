# Raspberry Pi

The standard device in almost any homelab, you can never have enough of them until you have too many.
Luckily for me I only have 2. They both have PoE+ hats that allow them to be connected to the internet
and get power with one cable.

## Hardware

- 2GB RAM
- 16GB USB Drive
- PoE+ Hat
- 1x Broadcom BCM2711 CPU @ 1.5GHz
- 1x The Pi Hut Laser Cut Case

## Services

The services running on the Raspberry Pis are listed here. This list is updated frequently.

As my HomeLab has two identical Raspberry Pis, it can run many services in a hot-hot/hot-cold format.
When listing what services are running, the hostname will be listed beside it.

| Service Name | Hostname       |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Pihole       | Apollo/Artemis |
