# Synology DS920+ // Dionysus

The Synology DS920+ was my biggest investment for my homelab. It cost upwards of â‚¬1,200 for both the server and
the storage disks. However, this was one of the best investments I've made. It will last for a long time and
should pay itself back.

## Hardware

- 4GB RAM
- 16TB Raw Storage, 10TB Usable RAID 5
- 1x Intel(R) Celeron(R) J4125 CPU @ 2.00GHz
