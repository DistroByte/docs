# Homelab Documentation

Welcome to the docs for my homelab!

These docs will serve as both a refernce for me, and a possible place for people to start their own homelabs.

### [Redbrick](https://redbrick.dcu.ie)

Redbrick is DCU's Computing and Networking Society. I am a SysAdmin there where I run 13 servers with a range of services
from Email to markdown editors. I work with Ubuntu, Debian and NixOS and it is all voluntary. Some of our best achievements
include resolving an issue with Mailman - our mailing list provider. You can read about our journey [here](https://md.redbrick.dcu.ie/s/r1TBqdiBu#).
