# DDClient

DDClient is a service that connects with Cloudflare to update my ip address whenever it is needed. By default
it does so every 15 minutes.

DDClient runs as a systemd service under the name `ddclient`. The only times it needs to be restarted is when
the config file is changed.

## Configuration

DDClient doesn't need much to function well, just the zone you want to update, your email address associated
with your cloudflare account, and an API key to authorize itself.

The configuration file is located at `/etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf`.

```conf
# Configuration file for ddclient generated by debconf
#
# /etc/ddclient.conf

use=web, web=checkip.dyndns.com/, web-skip='IP Address'
ssl=yes

protocol=cloudflare
server=api.cloudflare.com/client/v4
login=[super secret email address]
password=[super secret API key]

zone=james-hackett.ie
